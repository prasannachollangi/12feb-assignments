#write a program to compare 2 numbers:-
n1=int(input('Enter number 1 value:'))
n2=int(input('Enter number 2 value:'))
if n1!=n2:
  print('n1 and n2 are not equal')
if n1>n2:
    print('n1 is bigger than n2')              
elif n1<n2:
    print('n1 is smaller than n2')
else:
    print('n1 and n2 are equal') 

OUTPUT1:- 
Enter number 1 value:3
Enter number 2 value:3
n1 and n2 are equal
OUTPUT2:-
Enter number 1 value:34
Enter number 2 value:43
n1 and n2 are not equal
n1 is smaller than n2
